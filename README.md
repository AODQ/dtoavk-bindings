# dtoavk bindings

Static bindings for dtoavk. I pretty much can't use any existing D bindings
outside of the few from BindBC, because dtoavk is written in BetterC. They're
all autogenerated and manually sifted through to remove weird autogen quirks.

Really this should be split out into multiple modules, possibly BindBC, but
these don't exist as dynamic bindings so they really aren't polished for
external usage.  I don't plan on allowing dynamic bindings to work with dtoavk
any time soon either.

Currently support:
  - vulkan
  - glfw
  - imgui through cimgui, with glfw+vulkan implementation
